Welcome. I'm Omar Maaouane, and this is my personal space on the web.

I've been meaning to build this site for a while now. Not because the world needs another developer blog — it doesn't — but because I wanted a place that's mine. No algorithms deciding what you see, no character limits, no engagement metrics. Just words on a page.

## What to expect

I plan to write about things I find interesting:

- **Engineering problems** — the kind that make you stare at a terminal for hours, then feel unreasonably satisfied when the fix is a single line
- **Infrastructure and tooling** — how things are built, deployed, and kept running
- **Lessons learned** — from mistakes, mostly, because that's where the good ones come from
- **Occasional thoughts** — on technology, craft, and whatever else comes to mind

## Why a static site?

I could have used a platform. Medium, Substack, Hashnode — they all exist and they all work fine. But there's something satisfying about building your own thing from scratch. You control the stack. You own the content. You decide what goes where.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), hosted on AWS (S3 + CloudFront), and deployed via GitHub Actions. The infrastructure is managed with Terraform. It costs about a dollar a month to run. I'll write more about the technical details in a follow-up post.

## Let's see where this goes

I'm not going to promise a posting schedule. That's a recipe for guilt and abandoned blogs. I'll write when I have something worth saying.

Thanks for stopping by.
