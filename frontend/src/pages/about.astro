    <h1>About</h1>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        I'm Omar Maaouane, a software engineer based in London, UK. I work across the
        stack but gravitate towards backend systems, infrastructure, and developer
        tooling — the kind of work where you're building the platform that other
        people build on.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care about writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that are
        simple enough to reason about at 3am when something breaks. I believe the
        best infrastructure is the kind you forget exists because it just works.
      </p>

      <h2>What I work with</h2>

      <p>
        My day-to-day involves a mix of languages and tools, but the constants are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud &amp; Infrastructure</strong> — AWS, Terraform, Docker, CI/CD pipelines</li>
        <li><strong>Backend</strong> — APIs, microservices, distributed systems</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend</strong> — when needed, with a preference for minimal tooling</li>
        <li><strong>Automation</strong> — if I do something twice, the third time is a script</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Beyond code</h2>

      <p>
        Outside of work, you'll find me exploring London, reading (mostly non-fiction
        and sci-fi), tinkering with side projects, or trying to convince myself that
        running in British weather builds character.
      </p>

      <h2>This site</h2>

      <p>
        Built with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, hosted on AWS (S3 +
        CloudFront), infrastructure managed with Terraform, deployed via GitHub
        Actions. It costs about £1-2 a month to run. You can read more about the
        technical details in my
        <a href="/blog/building-this-site/">post about building this site</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Get in touch</h2>

      <p>
        The best way to reach me is via email or on GitHub. I'm always happy to chat
        about interesting problems, potential collaborations, or just to say hello.
